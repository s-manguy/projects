# Shiny Agency : Create an SPA with React Router
This SPA project is based on the [Créez une application React complète](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/7150606-creez-une-application-react-complete) course written by Alexia Toulmet for OpenClassrooms.  


*Remark : there are four versions of this project :*
* *first version : this one.*  
* *second version: [react, react-router & react-redux](https://github.com/s-manguy/projects/tree/main/front-end-libraries/oc-05-shiny-agency-redux)*    
* *third version : [react, react-router, react-redux & react-toolkit](https://github.com/s-manguy/projects/tree/main/front-end-libraries/oc-05-shiny-agency-redux-toolkit)*   
* *fourth version: [react, react-router, react-redux, react-toolkit & useQuery](https://github.com/s-manguy/projects/tree/main/front-end-libraries/oc-05-shiny-agency-redux-and-usequery)*

## Objectives:
* Create a **Single Page Application** with Create React App and React Router.
* Think about the SPA structure (organize the files of the app, respect the patterns).
* Install and use the Prettier plugin.
* Use Proptypes.
* Use the styled components.
* Master the hooks:
  * Create contexts.
  * Call API.
  * Use useState, useEffect and useContext.
  * Create custom hooks.
* Accessibility : 
  * Create a Dark theme.
  * Create a 404 error page.
* Create a survey and the different survey results.
* Test the SPA with Jest and the React Testing Library.
* Use function components and class components.
* Respect accurately the Figma Mockup.

## Utils:
* a [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/KlrToaA7Dj1Sm0opq37ICg/React-interm%C3%A9diaire?node-id=0%3A1)
* React : CRA, React Router
* Jest, React Testing Library
* an [API](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/7150606-API-React-intermediaire)
* yarn, git

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More
