# The freeCodeCamp project : Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
This project is the fifth and last of five projects to obtain the [**RWD Certification**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc3ab085a4-3e2d-4160-a445-50914111cc0d/responsive-web-design).

Have a look at the [codepen](https://codepen.io/s-manguy/full/KKapbzd) realised on 2021/03/24.

## Instructions
**Objective** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG.

**Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.**

*You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!*

## My way of working
1. Search portfolio examples on the internet to get inspiration.
2. Decrypt the code of the liked examples.
3. Think about the design, the colors, the fonts...
4. Search how to make overlays.
5. Work on the projects screencasts.
6. Work on the skills list...
7. Search icons.
8. **Design** the project **using the Material Design** rules.
9. **Code** the Landing Page **in HTML and CSS** as these are the languages studied in the RWD module : [codepen](https://codepen.io/s-manguy/full/KKapbzd).
